# Pizza Sales Dashboard

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to extract insights on total sales, order trends, category performance, and customer behavior. The analysis is visualized through an interactive dashboard created using Power BI, with SQL and Excel used for data manipulation and preparation.

## Key Features:
- **Total Revenue & Orders**: Highlights total revenue generated and the total number of pizzas sold across different time periods.
- **Busiest Days and Times**: Identifies peak days and times for pizza orders, with special focus on weekends and evenings.
- **Top and Bottom Selling Pizzas**: Visualizes the most and least popular pizzas based on total sales, quantity, and average order value.
- **Category and Size Analysis**: Breaks down pizza sales by category (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Chicken) and size (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- **Monthly Trends**: Displays monthly order and revenue trends, allowing for seasonal analysis and forecasting.
- **Customer Behavior**: Explores average order value and average pizzas per order to understand customer purchasing patterns.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: Utilized for querying and extracting raw pizza sales data.
- **Excel**: Used for cleaning and pre-processing data.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization tool used to create the dashboard and present insights.

## Dashboard Insights:
- **Busiest Days**: Most pizza orders occur on weekends, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays.
- **Monthly Trends**: The highest sales volumes are seen in January and July, with the lowest in December.
- **Top-Selling Pizzas**: The Classic Deluxe Pizza and Thai Chicken Pizza are the top revenue-generating pizzas.
- **Pizza Size Impact**: Large pizzas contribute to the highest sales figures.
- **Best-Selling Category**: The "Classic" pizza category contributes the most to total sales and orders.

## How to Use:
- Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or another source of pizza sales data.
- Import the data into SQL for querying and manipulation.
- Use Excel to clean and prepare the dataset for visualization.
- Load the dataset into Power BI to replicate the dashboard and gain insights from the data.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze customer demographics and order behavior to further improve targeted marketing.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Implement predictive analytics to forecast future pizza sales based on historical data.
- **Promotional Impact Analysis**: Assess how promotions impact sales and revenue over time.

## Repository Structure:
- **/SQL**: Contains SQL scripts used for querying and data extraction.
- **/Excel**: Excel sheets used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **/PowerBI**: Power BI files and dashboards.
- **/Data**: Raw and cleaned datasets (if permissible to share).
